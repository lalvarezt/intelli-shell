# TLDR Integration

The `tldr` subcommand provides a powerful way to manage and interact with the community-driven
[tldr pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr). It allows you to populate your command library with practical,
real-world examples for thousands of command-line tools.

This integration is designed to give you a head start, so you don't have to build your entire command library from
scratch. It acts as a powerful form of **command discovery**; when you're unsure how to use a tool like `tar` or
`ffmpeg`, the imported `tldr` examples provide a set of ready-to-use templates directly in your search results.

## Available Subcommands

The `tldr` functionality is split into two main subcommands:

- **[fetch](./tldr_fetch.md)**: Downloads and imports command examples from the `tldr` repository.
- **[clear](./tldr_clear.md)**: Removes previously imported `tldr` commands from your local library.

These commands provide a simple yet effective way to manage the `tldr` content within IntelliShell, allowing you to
keep your command library relevant and up-to-date with community-driven examples.
