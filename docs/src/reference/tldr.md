# tldr Integration

The `tldr` subcommand provides a powerful way to manage and interact with the community-driven
[tldr pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr). It allows you to populate your command library with practical,
real-world examples for thousands of command-line tools.

This integration is designed to give you a head start, so you don't have to build your entire command library from
scratch. With a single command, you can import hundreds of useful command templates, complete with variables, ready for
you to use.

The `tldr` functionality is split into two main subcommands:

- **[fetch](./tldr_fetch.md)**: Downloads and imports command examples from the `tldr` repository.
- **[clear](./tldr_clear.md)**: Removes previously imported `tldr` commands from your local library.

These commands provide a simple yet effective way to manage the `tldr` content within IntelliShell, allowing you to
keep your command library relevant and up-to-date.
