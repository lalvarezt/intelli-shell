# Introduction

_Like IntelliSense, but for shells!_

Welcome to the official guide for IntelliShell. If you find yourself constantly searching your shell history for that
one-trick `awk` command, forgetting the exact flags for `tar`, or re-typing long commands with only minor changes,
then you've come to the right place.

IntelliShell is a smart command-line assistant designed to solve these exact problems. It helps you save, find,
generate, and fix your most valuable commands directly within your terminal, turning your command line from a
simple execution tool into a structured, searchable, and **intelligent library**.

## Key Features

IntelliShell is built with a focus on **user experience**, efficiency and seamless integration:

- **Instant Access**: Find and execute commands in seconds with an interactive search UI, triggered by a simple
  keybinding (`ctrl+space`).

- **Command Templates**: Create powerful command templates using `{{variables}}`. IntelliShell will prompt you to fill
  them in on the fly, making your commands reusable for any scenario.

- **Smart Completions**: Power up your templates by defining custom scripts that generate live suggestions for your
  variables, like listing available git branches or docker containers.

- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Generate complex commands from natural language, instantly fix errors in your last command,
  and import templates from any text sourceâ€”all powered by your favorite language models.

- **Effortless Organization**: Use descriptions and hashtags (`#work`, `#maintenance`) to categorize your commands, making
  them easy to filter and find.

- **Workspace-Aware**: Automatically load workspace-specific commands and completions from a `.intellishell` file in your
  current folder or workspace.

- **Sync & Share**: Export your command library to a file, an HTTP endpoint, or a GitHub Gist to back it up or share it
  with your team.

- **Extensible Knowledge**: Instantly boost your library by fetching and importing command examples from the
  community-driven _tldr_ pages (or virtually any blog post or content with AI enabled).
